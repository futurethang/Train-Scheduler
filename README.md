# Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler

### Overview

With this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website will provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Challenges

This project presented some very challenging problems to solve, but is a great basis for building upon to add a lot of interesting features for more dynamic user interaction and data calculation.

Firebase is a powerful technology, but it is vast and the documentation is deep, and with Google's recent acquisition, there seems to be slightly fewer online resources than imagined to help target and tackle specific cases. As an introduction to some of the realtime database capabilities, this project gave a lot. 

Using the Moment.js library opened my eyes to the power of great add-ons, and offrered a lesson in looking for great tools when beginning any project, or even approaching a complex problem. Although difficult to figure out at first, it allowed the more complex calculations without re-inventing any wheels.

In the end, I am satisfied with this simple demonstration of data entry and stored information that persists in a remote location.
